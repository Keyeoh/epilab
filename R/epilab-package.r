#' EpiLab - Illumina Methylation Microrray
#'
#' Compilation of data, functions and other stuff intended to be used
#' inside the EpiLab for the implementation of data processing workflows. Most
#' of the functions are related to the analysis of Illumina 450k microarrays.
#' For now, the number of functions and methods is so low that I have decide
#' to keep everything inside only one package. In the future, this package
#' might be splitted to take into account the different aspects of the lab
#' workflows.
